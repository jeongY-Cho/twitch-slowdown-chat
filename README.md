# Twitch Chat Counter

This simple app groups and counts similar Twitch chat messages.

## Motivation

Lots of streamers poll twitch chat for sentiment. And often for larger streamers twitch chat moves so quickly that a true aggregation cannot realistically be made. To resolve this a streamer may go to strawpoll to create a poll and link people over. I offer through this project a simple 'in-chat' solution that instead groups similar chat messages and displays a count of them. This solution allows a twitch streamer to poll their chat without needing to set up a strawpoll or rely on human intuition.
